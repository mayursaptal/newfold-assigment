Analyze the following film and provide a summary in JSON format with exactly these keys: title, rating, recommended (boolean).

Film details:
{{$film_text}}

IMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. No markdown, no code blocks, just pure JSON.
The JSON must have exactly these keys: "title", "rating", "recommended" (boolean).

For the "recommended" field, evaluate the film objectively:
- Set it to TRUE if the description suggests:
  * An interesting or unique plot/concept
  * Engaging characters or storylines
  * Entertainment value or appeal
  * Generally positive or neutral description
  
- Set it to FALSE if the description clearly indicates:
  * Very generic or formulaic content
  * Uninteresting or dull plot
  * Poor quality indicators
  * Negative or unappealing description

Use a balanced approach: recommend films that seem reasonably interesting or entertaining, but don't recommend films that are clearly generic, boring, or unappealing based on the description.

Respond in this exact format:
{"title": "...", "rating": "...", "recommended": true/false}
