Analyze the following user question and determine which agent should handle it.

User Question: {{$question}}

Available Agents:
1. SearchAgent - Handles questions about specific films, including:
   - Film titles, ratings, rental rates, categories
   - Questions like "What is the rating of [film]?", "How much does [film] cost to rent?", "What category is [film]?"
   - Any question that mentions a specific film title or asks about film database information

2. LLMAgent - Handles general questions, including:
   - General knowledge questions
   - Questions not related to films
   - Conversational questions
   - Questions that don't require database lookups

IMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. No markdown, no code blocks, just pure JSON.
The JSON must have exactly these keys: "agent" (string: "SearchAgent" or "LLMAgent"), "confidence" (float 0.0-1.0), "reasoning" (string: brief explanation).

Analyze the question carefully:
- If the question mentions a film title, asks about film ratings, rental rates, categories, or any film-specific information → Choose SearchAgent
- If the question is general knowledge, conversational, or unrelated to films → Choose LLMAgent
- If unsure but question might be about films → Choose SearchAgent (it can hand off to LLMAgent if no match found)

Respond in this exact format:
{"agent": "SearchAgent" or "LLMAgent", "confidence": 0.0-1.0, "reasoning": "brief explanation"}
